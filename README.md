DESCRIPTION: To write and run this C code demonstrating file operations and lexical analysis, you can use a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE) that supports the C programming language. Popular tools include Code::Blocks, Dev C++, Turbo C, Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with the C/C++ extension by Microsoft, or even an online compiler like OnlineGDB or Replit for instant execution without installation. Among these, Visual Studio Code is highly recommended for its lightweight interface, customization, syntax highlighting, terminal integration, and real-time error checking when configured with the GCC compiler. In this setup, you write the C code in .c files—such as file_operations.c and lexical_analyzer.c—using the editor panel, save them in a working directory, and compile the code using a terminal command like gcc filename.c -o outputname to generate an executable that can be run to see the program in action. The first program, file_operations.c, demonstrates basic file handling functions in C including creating a file, writing content to it, appending data, and reading the final content. It uses standard file I/O functions like fopen, fprintf, fgetc, and fclose, helping students and developers understand how to manipulate files using different modes like "w", "a", and "r". The second program, lexical_analyzer.c, acts as a basic lexical analyzer that scans another C file (such as test_code.c) and identifies tokens such as keywords (int, float, return), identifiers (like variable names), numbers (e.g., 10, 20.5), and operators (+, -, =). This code uses character-by-character input and conditional logic (using isalpha, isdigit, strcmp, etc.) to separate and classify each token, providing a simple example of how compiler front-ends work during the lexical analysis phase. To test the lexical analyzer, the user creates a sample input file named test_code.c with basic C syntax. When the analyzer runs, it processes the file and prints out each token type and its value. Both programs are essential for understanding key concepts in systems programming and compiler design. Visual Studio Code is particularly helpful in organizing these files in a single workspace, viewing multiple source files side by side, and compiling/running them within the terminal pane. With syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and extensions, it greatly enhances coding efficiency. This environment makes it ideal for students, educators, and professionals who want to experiment with and learn C programming and compiler concepts.
